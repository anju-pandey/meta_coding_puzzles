When a frog hops, it moves to the nearest lily pad after its current lily pad which is not currently occupied by another frog (hopping over any other frogs on intermediate lily pads along the way). If this causes it to reach lily pad N, it will immediately exit onto the shore. Multiple frogs may not simultaneously hop during the same second.\n",
